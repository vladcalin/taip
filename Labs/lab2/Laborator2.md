Secret Sharing Schemes with Applications in Security Protocols (Sorin Iftene, 2007):  
http://profs.info.uaic.ro/~tr/tr07-01.pdf

> General information about secret sharing schemes and their applications.

Secret Sharing Homomorphism and Secure E-voting: 
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.05372.pdf

> The usage of homomorphic properties of some systems (ex: the Shamir Secret Sharing scheme or the El Gamal Cryptosystem) for obtaining security properties (idea: Encrypting the subsecrets with El Gamal and securely reconstruct the secret)

A New Secret Sharing Scheme With Priority in Order of Sharing and its Application in Multi Authority E-voting Systems: 
https://periodicos.ufsm.br/cienciaenatura/article/viewFile/20761/pdf

>  Secret sharing schemes has 2 main aims: to decrease the risks of attacks by adversaries which can be done by
increasing the number of authorities and to remove the dependence of protocol to an special part. We can use the proposed secret sharing scheme with priority in order of sharing to obtain a more secure system for our application.

Secret-Sharing Schemes: A Survey: 
https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~beimel/Papers/Survey.pdf

> Here are described various properties of linear secret-sharing schemes, which is a class of schemes based on linear algebra that contains most known schemes. The properties that are discussed in this paper are directly related to efficiency.

Important topics to be covered:

- Blakley’s Scheme
- Shamir’s Scheme
- Mignotte’s Scheme
- Weighted Threshold Secret Sharing Schemes
- The verifiability of the secret shares: Feldman’s Scheme, Pedersen’s Scheme



Application developing
======================

Client-server architecture using the HTTP stack by implementing a web UI and a specialized API for integration with other services.


Server-side
-----------

- a specialized backend language such as Java, Python, Nodejs, etc
- a database engine for data persistance - MongoDB or PostgreSQL (
- a distributed architecture for efficient processing of data (such as parameter generation, validation, various computations, etc).

Client-side
-----------

- HTML, CSS, Javascript
- specific frameworks: Bootstrap
